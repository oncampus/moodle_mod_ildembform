# Embedded contact form

The embedded contact form can be included as an activity to any 
Moodle course and will provide a simple form to get in contact
with one or more named responsible person.

## Installation

Just clone or download the latest version from the master branch to 
your Moodle installation and walk through the site update process or 
run the upgrade.php from command line:

    $ php admin/cli/upgrade.php --non-interactive

After the installation you can add the contact form from the 
activity picker to any course. 

In the mod settings you have the following options:

without additional link
